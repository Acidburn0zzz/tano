Tano - an open IP TV player

Tano is an open-source cross-platform IP TV player. It features
full IP TV playback with EPG and recorder. Project started
because of a need of a simple IP TV player on Linux providing EPG.
Now after more than one year of development, Tano is getting more
and more stable and feature complete.

Tano is free (libre) software. This means that the application
source code is available to public, anyone is welcome to research
how the application works, participate in its development, freely
distribute the application and spread the word!

Tano runs on Linux and Windows,
other operating systems are currently not supported.
Current EPG support is only for Slovenian providers.
